## **Visual & Feature Enhancements**

Photogenetic modifies Minecraft's appearance and adds features using client-side enhancements. Designed to work on any vanilla server, it includes:

*   **Dual Pre-Configured Shaders:** Includes two configured shader packs based on Complimentary Shaders, set up for immediate use:
    *   One setup for **Ray-Tracing**, enabling ray-traced lighting, shadows, and reflections. (Complimentary with Euphoria patches)
    *   One **Non-Ray Traced** version providing shader effects with higher performance compared to the ray-tracing option. (Rethinking Voxels)
*   **PBR Texture Support:** Includes PBR resourcepacks for better textures, reflections and details on every block.
*   **Enhanced Animations:** Includes modifications for player and environmental animations.
*   **Increased Render Distance:** This modpack has DistantHorizons support, which is also shipped with the modpack.
*   **UI Modifications:** Includes changes to the user interface.
*   **Quality of Life Utilities:** Includes utilities such as an in-game screenshot viewer, a screenshot-to-clipboard function, camera zoom and much more.
* **Fully Optimized:** Photogenetic is powered and built upon my modpack Velocity for optimization.

## **Client-Side & Compatibility**

*   **Purely Client-Side:** Can be used to join any vanilla Minecraft server without server-side installation.
*   **Mod Compatibility Note:** While Photogenetic is designed as a client-sided modpack, compatibility with other mods is not guaranteed nor tested.
*   **OLED Screen:** The visual changes may appear more pronounced on OLED displays due to their contrast capabilities.
